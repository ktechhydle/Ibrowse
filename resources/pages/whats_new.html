            <p>
                Ibrowse 2.0 includes a <b>complete ui overhaul</b>, with a
                re-designed look to feel even more modern.
            </p>

                </li>
                <li>Print pages (finally!)</li>

                <li>Clear caches no longer requires a full restart</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Ibrowse 2.0 has been <b>heavily optimized</b>, we actually saw
                loading times decrease by over 50%!
            </p>
            <p>
                Tabs load and create faster, as we put some of the core logic
                into the main tab view. This means dialogs and actions are only
                created <b>one time</b>, compared to previous versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the new lock tab feature, you can secure tabs if you need
                to step away from the desk. Co-workers can't sneak by and look
                at what you are browsing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a tab is locked, you can still stay inside of it and use it.
                It essentially means, as soon as a diffferent tab is opened, the
                locked one can't be accessed. It is manually unlocked by right
                clicking.
